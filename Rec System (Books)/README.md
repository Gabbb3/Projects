### Summary

## Objective

Using the popular BX data (http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/), create a recommender system using item-based collaborative filtering - matrix factorization.

## Key Results

While the dataset was reduced to USA/Canada due to computational limitations, it was still interesting to see some books recommended to readers of a certain book.

The system at first glance seems accurate - With LOTR (Fellowship of the Ring) as the base, the top 4 books recommended was of the same LOTR franchise too.

## Next Steps

It will be interesting to look into scalable recommender systems via SparkML.
